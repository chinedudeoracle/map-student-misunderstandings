Welcome to the GitHub project board for our participation in the [MAP Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/map-2024). We're organizing the pipeline using agile sprints to stay focused and maximize submission quality.

## 📅 Sprint Breakdown

| Sprint | Goal                          | Tags                   |
|--------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| 1. 📊 EDA & Preprocessing              | Clean, explore, prep   | `epic: eda`             |
| 2. 🧪 Baseline Modeling                | Build benchmarks       | `epic: baseline`        |
| 3. 🛠️ Feature Engineering             | Add new features       | `epic: features`        |
| 4. 🚀 Modeling & Optimization         | Tune + validate models | `epic: modeling`        |
| 5. 🧼 Final Polish & Submission       | Stack & automate       | `epic: polish`          |

## 🎯 Objectives

- Submit at least 2 quality models weekly
- Maintain reproducible codebase
- Use issue labels to track epics, priorities, and types

## 🧷 Labels

- **Epic Tags:** `epic: eda`, `epic: baseline`, `epic: features`, `epic: modeling`, `epic: polish`
- **Type Tags:** `type: task`, `type: goal`
- **Priority:** `priority: high`, `priority: medium`, `priority: low`

## 📌 Tips

- Keep sprints 1 week long, ending every Sunday.
- Track issues via milestones or GitHub Projects board.
- Reuse successful modeling pipelines with different feature sets.
